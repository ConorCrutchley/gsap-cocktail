# GSAP Cocktail

This website was built as part of a follow along video tutorial from JavaScript Mastery which can be found at:

The course teaches you how to use Green Sock Animation Platform (AKA GSAP) to implement stunning animations onto your website.

The premise here is a cocktail website for a bar in America. GSAP is used to do the following:

- Play the video of ice falling into a cocktail glass as the user scrolls
- Add a paralax effect to the leaves on the screen
- Fade words, characters and lines into view as the user enters different sections of the page
- Add an image mask that expands into a full image when the user scrolls further down the page
- Provide transitions when navigating from one cocktail to another in the menu section

## Tools

The site was built using the latest versions of React, Vite and GSAP. It also uses TypeScript as opposed to JavaScript which was used in the tutorial.

## To Do

The site is complete and matchaes the end product of the tutorial. However, there are some changes which could be made to improve the site. Thes include:

- Updating the cocktail list. One of my hobbies is making cocktails and some of the cocktails mentioned on this page don't match the imagery. More accurate cocktail names / images would be more appropriate.
- Improve scrolling effect on some of the leaves.
- Attempt to make the video in the hero section stand out more instead of appearing behind the noisy background.
- See if there are more GSAP animations that could be added to this site.
